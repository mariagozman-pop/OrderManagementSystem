# Order Management System

## Project Overview
The Order Management System (OMS) is designed to facilitate the management of orders in a system where clients can place orders for products. The system supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations for clients, products, and orders, while also generating bills and tracking all operations.

## Features
- **Client Management**: Users can insert, update, view, and delete client records, including details like name, address, and contact information.
- **Product Management**: Users can manage product records with the ability to add, update, view, and delete product details such as name, quantity, price, and description.
- **Order Management**: Users can create new orders, update existing orders, and view order details, including client information and product details.
- **Billing**: The system generates bills for each order, detailing the client information and products purchased.
- **Logging**: All operations, including CRUD actions, are logged for tracking purposes.
- **Reports**: The system calculates and displays metrics like average waiting time and peak order processing hours.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs and system errors.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing (for GUI)
- MySQL (or any other database for data storage)

## Functional Requirements
### Client Management
- Add, update, view, and delete client records.
- Store details such as name, address, and contact information.

### Product Management
- Add, update, view, and delete product records.
- Store details such as name, quantity, price, and description.

### Order Management
- Create, update, view, and delete orders.
- Include details such as client information, product details, quantity, total price, and order date.

### Billing
- Generate and display bills for each order.

### Logging
- Log all operations for auditing and tracking purposes.

### Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully with informative user messages.

## Design Principles
- **Abstraction**: Utilizes classes and interfaces to hide implementation details.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundles data and methods into cohesive units for data integrity.
- **Polymorphism**: Implements interfaces for uniform treatment of different object types.
- **Modularity**: Organized into packages to promote code reuse and maintainability.

## Implementation Details
The application architecture is layered into:
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages database interactions using Data Access Objects (DAOs).
- **Business Logic Layer**: Processes data and implements the core functionalities.
- **Presentation Layer**: Contains the GUI components built with Java Swing for user interaction.

## Testing
The system undergoes comprehensive testing, including:
- Unit tests for individual components.
- Integration tests for interactions between components.
- User acceptance testing to validate usability and functionality.
